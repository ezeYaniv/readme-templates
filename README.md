# Introduction

Code examples and small projects are the output of learning to code. As one's breadth and depth of knowledge increases, however, so does the size - and often the disarray - of personal learning and project folders. 

In the moment, code may seem to have an obvious lesson or skill practiced. But after enough time, even the most trivial of learning projects suffers from "what was this project again?" syndrome. One may turn first to standardized naming conventions. But, the variance in learning sources, project scopes, and types of technologies defy simple categorization.

Enter the humble README file.

README files serve to answer a few simple questions:
* What does this project do?
* How does it work?
* What technologies or skills did I use?
* What did I learn?
* Current status of code (finished/unfinished? issues? improvements?)

Whether or not a user keeps centralized documentation about their learning process, a README file which quickly answers the questions above helps a user sift through past projects faster.

# Usage

Use the README template for every project, no matter how small or simple, so future you can quickly review and understand what it accomplished.
